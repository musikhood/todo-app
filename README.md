# Todo App

---

## Description

It's fancy todo app with two themes (light and dark) and ability to drag your tasks.\
I also added local storage, so when you leave or refresh this website all of your task will be saved.\
I created this app to test my react skills and try new npm package to drag objects.\
Hardest thing to make in this app were draggable objects, but after much trails and errors I managed to finish this project.\
I'm really happy with the results. App is available there: [link](https://musikhood.github.io/todo-app/)
